# Description

To showcase my web design skills for potential employers, I designed a portfolio webpage which includes a brief overview about me, upcoming and completed projects, and contact links. The webpage serves as both a responsive resume and advertisement of my skills. While building this webpage, I learned the importance of logical semantic structure and its benefits while styling, responsive design to capture all viewports across many devices, and how efficient variables are for code management.
