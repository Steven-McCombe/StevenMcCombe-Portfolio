# Description
In this project I designed a portfolio webpage that gives visitors a small bit of information about me and also to showcase my web design skills to potential employers. It also has various contact links for anyone who needs to get in touch with me. The webpage is designed in a way that is fully responsive for wide screen monitors and mobile users. While building this webpage i learned the importance of logical semantic structure and its benefits when it comes to styling. I learned that using variables is extremely efficient for code management.
